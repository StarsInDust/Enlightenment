<h1><a name="_Toc190918479">Why are we on Loft instead of G Stretch?</a></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I know you are probably wondering what happened to that last  lesson on G Stretch, and why we are skipping it, and going straight on through  to this tutorial on the Loft tool. Well although, Loop tools are a fantastic  add-on in most cases, because it is a 3<sup>rd</sup> party tool, and not  maintained by the Blender team itself, things can get a bit buggy when Blender  decides to massively update some things; so sometimes these third parties like,  the Loop Tool&rsquo;s company, has not quit got it all-together yet and caught up. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is the case with G Stretch. G stretch relies enormously  on either the Annotation tool, or the G pencil tool, for it to work. This is a  difference between this tool and the other tools in this arsenal. So, the problem  here lies in the fact that Blender has tremendously updated these drawing  tools, and so now Loop tool does not any longer know how to connect to them.  This is a problem, and the reason why (for now) we are skipping over the G  stretch tool, and going on to the next tool, which is: Loft.</p>



<h1><a name="_Toc190918480">What is the Loft Tool?</a></h1>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="line-height:115%; font-size:12.0pt; ">Loft  tool</span></span> is kind of like the bridge tool, and so it will also take  some mesh shapes, and attempt to make a bridge, or loft between the objects. The  loft tool and the bridge tool are very similar. They are so similar that they  will share the same Last Operation dialog box at the bottom of the screen. Be  careful, because when you are changing the settings for one, you are also changing  the settings for bridge tool, which as you remember is the first tool in this  Loop tool treasure chest.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc190918481">Prepping the Objects</a></h1>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Let&rsquo;s start by adding some Circles to the viewport, so we  have something to work with</p>

<img src="Articles/2025/1-Blender-Continued/7-Loop-Tools/6-Loft/Images/3.png" width="487" height="127" class="responsiveImage">

<p class="MsoNormal">If you added it in front view, you will need to rotate the  object 90°  on the X axis to make it stand up. Make sure you are in the <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Rotation</span></span> setting, and  not in Location setting, or your object will go flying off of the screen.</p>

<img src="Articles/2025/1-Blender-Continued/7-Loop-Tools/6-Loft/Images/4.png" width="251" height="493" class="responsiveImage">


<p class="MsoNormal">Hit the <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">3 </span></span>key on the numpad, so that it will turn this  circle; now we can look at it from its side view. We want to then hit the <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Shift – D</span></span> key to  duplicate your first circle to make several more. Since this Loft tool can be  very finicky, we will want to hit the <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">M</span></span> key to move the object and  then hit the <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Y </span></span>key to constrain the movement to the <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Y</span></span> axis. We are looking at  these circles from the side, so they should look like thin straight lines. But  we need to make that constraining move to keep everything in a perfectly  straight line. </p>

<h1><a name="_Toc190918482">Joining Objects Together</a></h1>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is one of the <span class="BoldRedChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">got-cha  things</span></span> in Blender, whereas if you do not do it, you will never  get anywhere except driven crazy. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you are working with multiple objects in Blender, they <span class="BoldRedChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">MUST </span></span>be joined together before leaving object  mode to enter Edit mode. So, while still in <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Object </span></span>mode, make sure that you  select all of the objects that you want to work with. Then hit  <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">CTRL-J</span></span> and join them together.</p>



<img src="Articles/2025/1-Blender-Continued/7-Loop-Tools/6-Loft/Images/6.png" width="417" height="133" class="wideImg">
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="Articles/2025/1-Blender-Continued/7-Loop-Tools/6-Loft/Images/7.png" width="621" height="298" class="wideImg"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You will know they are joined together, because these  circles will all turn orange. Instead of one circle being orange, and the rest  of them being a red color.</p>


<h1><a name="_Toc190918483">Starting to Loft the Objects</a></h1>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now we can enter <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Edit</span></span> Mode</p>

<img src="Articles/2025/1-Blender-Continued/7-Loop-Tools/6-Loft/Images/8.png" width="540" height="274" class="responsiveImage">

<p class="MsoNormal">With all of the circles selected, <span class="BoldMaroonListChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">right  click</span></span> and select <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Loft</span></span> from the Loop Tool  section.</p>

<img src="Articles/2025/1-Blender-Continued/7-Loop-Tools/6-Loft/Images/9.png" width="574" height="216" class="responsiveImage">
<p class="BlueBolden">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ok, well this is what mine looked like after hitting that  Loft button, but yours might look different depending on what your settings  have started out with for this tool. It will usually give us (by default) some  weird settings, and we will need to straight this mess out. </p>

<img src="Articles/2025/1-Blender-Continued/7-Loop-Tools/6-Loft/Images/10.png" width="617" height="346" class="wideImg">

<p class="MsoNormal">This is the settings that I was given, and this is why  things are weird.</p>

<img src="Articles/2025/1-Blender-Continued/7-Loop-Tools/6-Loft/Images/11.png" width="346" height="190" class="responsiveImage">

<p class="MsoNormal">We want to change these settings to this. <span class="BoldMaroonListChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Unchecking</span></span> that <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Reverse</span></span> checkbox can really make a difference. </p>

<img src="Articles/2025/1-Blender-Continued/7-Loop-Tools/6-Loft/Images/12.png" width="345" height="182" class="responsiveImage">

<p class="MsoNormal">Now it looks like this</p>

<img src="Articles/2025/1-Blender-Continued/7-Loop-Tools/6-Loft/Images/13.png" width="424" height="290" class="responsiveImage">
<p class="BlueBolden">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BlueBolden">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BlueBolden">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once we get it straightened out, you can start to add more  segments to it.</p>

<img src="Articles/2025/1-Blender-Continued/7-Loop-Tools/6-Loft/Images/14.png" width="621" height="467" class="wideImg">
<p class="BlueBolden">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BlueBolden">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BlueBolden">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can even try and twist it.</p>

<img src="Articles/2025/1-Blender-Continued/7-Loop-Tools/6-Loft/Images/15.png" width="622" height="462" class="wideImg">



<p class="MsoNormal">But if you throw in that <span class="BoldRedChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Reverse</span></span> check box, you get a mess.</p>

<img src="Articles/2025/1-Blender-Continued/7-Loop-Tools/6-Loft/Images/16.png" width="618" height="392" class="wideImg">

<p class="MsoNormal">However, as you can see from this next image, these  following settings seem to be the best. We could even go with less segments and  get better optimization. Then if we try to animate it, it would react faster.  Especially if your scene was quite complex, with other objects that weighed  your animation down.</p>

<img src="Articles/2025/1-Blender-Continued/7-Loop-Tools/6-Loft/Images/17.png" width="567" height="453" class="responsiveImage">

<p class="MsoNormal">So, I guess that is about it for this one. Start lofting a  few of your own objects and see what you can come up with.</p>

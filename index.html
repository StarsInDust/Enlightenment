    <p>This week, I have a tutorial pertaining to Programming. Yes, we are jumping off of the graphic arts train for a little bit, and going a bit on the wild side. Or that is the programming wild side. This week, we will be learning how a programmers actually finds the code he needs to begin to write his Python and Tkinter projects. Libraries of code can be quite vast, and you don’t really need to know everything. A lot of the things that you find that you will want to perform in programming is already written for you. If you know where to look. And this is just what this tutorial is all about. Helping you find the path to start writing your code.</p>

    
    <p>So, if this sounds interesting to you, then please join us for this week’s article entitled:</p>

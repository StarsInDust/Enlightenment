    <p class="pSilver">This week, we will be jumping temporarily outside of learning the Tools panel in Edit mode, inside of Blender, so that I can bring you into an important concept concerning Ngons.
    <br>
<br>

Ngons are sometimes thrown at you on purpose by Blender, and sometimes you may unintentionally create them yourself. The thing is that these things are not 4 sided quads, and Blender for the most part prefers 4 sided quads. The problem with these things is that they tend to ignore some of your procedures, like loop cuts. This can be frustrating; in this tutorial I will try to present some work arounds for this problem.

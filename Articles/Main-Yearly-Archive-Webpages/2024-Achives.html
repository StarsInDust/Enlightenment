            <p class="LeftPSilver">This week, we will be looking at flex-box, and its fundamental aspects of it. What does flexbox see when it is looking at its code? Why do we use the properties that we use to talk to flexbox?</p>
            
            <p class="LeftPSilver">Foundational concepts might not be the most interesting of things to be studying when it comes to this styling ideal. But getting a strong foundation for what we are trying to achieve is very important, remember if your foundation is not sturdy to begin with, your entire learning house-of cards could come crashing down to the ground.</p>

We will first take a look at the old way of doing things with using block and inline blocks, and then give you a taste of how things are done with flexbox.

            <p class="LeftPSilver">This week we will be presenting the third part of our series on flexbox. Last week we showed you just a taste of what using properties of flexbox was like. This week, we will be looking at a whole lot more of those properties, and showing you some examples in both HTML and CSS, so you can test some of this stuff out for yourself.

            <p class="LeftPSilver">This Week, we will be taking a look at how we can use Autoprefixer with Visual Studio to help us automatically add all of the prefixing to our CSS. This can be very helpful, especially since technology in side of the web designing world will change in a heartbeat, and when it does, all browsers have not quite caught up with what we are trying to do. This is where Autoprefixer can help. We can install it into our Visual Studio and it will take our CSS page and make all of the changes for us. In that way, we can work with the latest stuff, and Autoprefixer will fix things, where everything just works.</p>

SASS is a way of being able to take your regular CSS file, and reduce the redundancy of the code by using variables and other techniques. It is an advanced version of writing CSS, but nothing to be afraid of. Soon you will be able to write this style of code easily and like an expert. </p>

            <p class="LeftPSilver">This week, we will be taking a look at how we can separate our files into individual modules. This will make things work faster and better. In addition, it can be very helpful for large projects where you have several different developers building the app. This way each employee can take their own piece of the pie (so-to-speak) and piece it back together to make a better whole.</p>

            <p class="LeftPSilver">This week, we will be looking at how to extend a class. In other languages, you might know this by the terminology of “Inheritance”, but SCSS likes to be a tad bit different and call it extending a class. If you are unfamiliar with this method, it is a way in which we can take all of the styles from one class and put it into a second class. This is done by simple stating that we want to @extend it. Then once this type of copying is accomplished, then we can take our second class and add some more styles to it, to make it more customized to what we are attempting to do.</p>

            <p class="LeftPSilver">This week, we will be looking at how we can create a project overlay for a page. This will be a colored rectangular shaped image that will be slightly transparent. When we hover over the element on the page which this colored area covering, it will cause the image to look as if it is rising up and covering over our portfolio images. This will be done using both pseudo elements and transitional SASS magic.  </p>

            <p class="LeftPSilver">This week, we will be looking at all of the tools in the Tools panel, in Object mode, while working in Blender. Blender is a huge program and it can be quite over-whelming, when you first look at it. So, I will be taking my time and trying to take baby steps in trying to explain this immense program.</p>

It is always a good beginning to look at the menus in any program that you are about to get into. Although Blender is very good, it is also massive, and you will start to get an idea of just how massive it really is, as we explore the different avenues that these menus buttons will lead you to.</p>

The Blender application is so vast that even a sub-menu needed to be broken up into bite-sized pieces in order to not overwhelm anyone trying to take on the venture of trying to learn this program. This section deals with options dealing with Gizmos, Overlays, Viewing Mode Options, and the tools on the right side of the viewport.</p>

The first thing that we will be exploring is the Tools menu and the differences of this menu than the one that we were introduced to in Object mode. Oh, you will see some of the same tools in there as we had before, but edit mode comes with a lot more tools packed in its side menu. This week we will spend some time into looking at the extrude tool, and how we can use it to mold our objects into something really useful.</p>

Not only does it create a face, but this face is new geometry on the 3D model, which we can use to further manipulate and mold our object into the desired outcome. </p>

This tool is used to create additional edge loops. You could use sub divide, but using the sub division method creates unified quad sections within your object. If you want more control over how many, or where your edge loops are placed, you are going to want to use the Loop Cut tool. You will soon find that this tool is one of your most essential tools inside of your edit mode tool box.</p>

And this is where the Knife tool comes in. </p>

            <p class="LeftPSilver">This week, we will be jumping temporarily outside of learning the Tools panel in Edit mode, inside of Blender, so that I can bring you into an important concept concerning Ngons.
            <br>
<br>

Ngons are sometimes thrown at you on purpose by Blender, and sometimes you may unintentionally create them yourself. The thing is that these things are not 4 sided quads, and Blender for the most part prefers 4 sided quads. The problem with these things is that they tend to ignore some of your procedures, like loop cuts. This can be frustrating; in this tutorial I will try to present some work arounds for this problem.

This movement is made by all vertices moving the same distance either outward to fatten your object, or inward to remove weight from an object. </p>

Or you can just simply use it to add a tilt to one of your object’s face.</p>

This menu is also a header menu, but as a sub menu it falls directly under and contains more specific items to the workspace. </p>

<h1><a name="_Toc159755087">What are CSS Media  Queries?</a></h1>
  <p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Media queries help our webpages in becoming more fluid. Even  though there tends to be some controversial information on when media queries actually  came into being, with some saying that they were introduced in CSS2, which was in  its final completion phase, when CSS3 was released in 1999.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
   <img src="Images/2.png" width="400" height="256" class="responsiveImage">
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Some of the later dates of its creation, sound a bit more  plausible because cell phones, and tablets in the beginning era of web page  creation were not quite as prevalent, and there simply was not that great of a  need for our pages to be fluid in sizing. So, from what I have gathered there  seems to have been some working draft for these things starting as early as in  2001, but it did not actually become a recommendation by W3C until June, 19<sup>th</sup> of 2012.Â  And then some proposed  corrections were published as recently as April 5<sup>th</sup>, 2022.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
   <h1><a name="_Toc159755088">What are some of the quirks of Media Queries?</a></h1>
   <p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif; ">Multiple Banner Images</span></strong></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Media Queries, are pretty good at being able to take care of  some of the issues that things like flexbox have not yet been able to resolve,  but it is not that they come completely free of all issues.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">For example, you will find that flex box will not be able to  completely handle your banner images, and so they will not look correct with  different sized devices. But while you can use media queries, and they work  very well; now you are faced with creating a separate image for every single  one of your different media types. And that is no small task.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">As I stated in my last tutorial, Web Page design. These are  your official sizes listed in large font size, but the sizes that actually  worked for my own devices were a bit different, and those sizes I listed below them  in the smaller font. You might even have to do your own finagling for things to  work for your own designs.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
   <img src="Images/3.png" width="695" height="274" class="wideImg">
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif; ">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif; ">CSS Placement for Media  Queries</span></strong></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Another issue that you will find to be a bit maddening about  these media queries, is there insistence on where they want to be placed in  your code. You <strong><span style="font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif; ">MUST</span></strong>, place  these media queries at the bottom of your CSS code. If you try to list any  other normal rule underneath of it, you will find that your CSS simply will not  listen to you. And if you find that your CSS is not paying you any attention, a  very good place to look is if your App for making web pages have automatically  thrown your new rule, under your media queries, and if it has, you will have to  drag it back up into a more appropriate position in your code.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

   <p class="MsoNormal"> <a href="#_Toc159755090">back </a><span class="MsoIntenseEmphasis"> </span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">I am going over some of the things that I have already  stated in my last tutorial, but learning how to use your media queries  correctly will be important, and reviewing this stuff can&rsquo;t hurt.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">if you are working with <strong>min-width</strong> in your media  queries, you want to make sure that you start with your <strong>smallest screen size  first</strong>. That is why we are starting with our screen size of 300. Of course,  if you are using max-width, you will need to start with your largest size  first. Order matters, when it comes to writing media queries.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
   <img src="Images/5.png" width="467" height="731" class="responsiveImage">
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
   <h1><a name="_Toc159755089">Unfamiliar Naming and color Coding</a></h1>
  <p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">If you are coming into media queries for the first time, the  syntax itself might seem a bit scary, but there isn&rsquo;t all that much to them. For  example, they are in that reddish brown color, so that you can distinguish them  from the regular rules you have in your CSS, and hopefully not forget that all  the code that does look this strange is placed last, and after all of your  regular rules.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">The <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="line-height:115%; font-size:12.0pt; ">@</span></span> sign in the media query rule, is just a part of its naming convention and is  further used to show this rule apart from being a normal rule.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

   <p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif; ">Customized Experience</span></strong></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Well, just in case you haven&rsquo;t figured out by now, media  queries are telling your web page that it wants it to act differently depending  on what dimensions it is being viewed at. You do not want an absolutely  humongous web image to be displayed at a cell phone size, any more than you  would want a tiny image to be showing on your desktop. You want your user to  feel as if their visual experience is being designed especially for them, and  with media queries essentially, they are. </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">You put the size that you want the rule to apply to inside  of the parenthesis following the media query declaration. You will state if  these rules will be following a min-width or max-width line of reasoning and  depending on what you chose, you will make sure that the order of these rules  are placed correctly, as stated earlier in this article <a href="#orderMatters">here</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif; ">Media Targeting</span></strong></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">You can target specific media using media queries.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
   <img src="Images/7.png" width="531" height="354" class="responsiveImage">
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
   <h1><a name="_Toc159755091">Syntax of media type targeting</a></h1>
  <p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
   <p class="blueEmphasis">â¦Ok fine, a list. But how do we actually use this, and where  do we put it. </p>
   <p class="blueEmphasis">&nbsp;</p>
   <p class="blueEmphasis">&nbsp;</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">You will need to start by creating different CSS documents.  One for print, and one for screen, and target those in the heading of the html  document like this. You see, <span style="color:red; ">media</span>, is built-in,  and it just works when you use it because someone wrote all of the code for it  to work under the hood. So, say <span style="color:red; ">media</span> <span style="color:blue; ">= &ldquo;print&rdquo;</span> and it knows how to handle that.</p>
   <img src="Images/8.png" width="626" height="187" class="wideImg">
<p class="MsoNormal">This is how the different rules are written in the appropriate  CSS document.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="_Hlk159752863"><span class="MsoIntenseEmphasis">screen.css </span></a></p>
   <img src="Images/9.png" width="323" height="128" class="responsiveImage">
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoIntenseEmphasis">print.css </span></p>

   <h1><a name="_Toc159755092">Specifying certain Tasks at Certain Sizes</a></h1>
   <p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes you might want things to behave differently in  your styling layout based on the size of the device. For example, if you want  to order different divs differently, if it gives your user a better visual user  experience. You can use media queries, and the <strong><span style="font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif; ">order</span></strong> property to get this one done.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">We explained how we were doing this in our last tutorial on  web page design also, but here is a short review again.</p>

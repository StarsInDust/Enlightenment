<p class="MsoNormal">This week, the code we will be writing will also only be an  insert for your own site. So, you would place the html code presented here  inside of your main content area.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When we hover over each image, their will be a transparent over-lay that shows up, with some text about the image. The overlay will disappear, when we move the mouse away from the image.</p>

   <p><img src="Images/2.png" width="629" height="294" class="wideImg"></p>
   <p>&nbsp; </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">We will again be using flexbox to get our images to behave.  We will place the entire thing in a container, but this time we will be doing  things just a bit differently. That is because our container will not be set to  flex. It will be the unordered list that we place inside of that container that  we will be setting to display as flex.</p>
   
  <img src="Images/3.png" width="475" height="179" class="wideImg">


   <p class="MsoNormal">I did put a background color into the container tag, but  that is all I did.</p>
   
   <p><img src="Images/4.png" width="278" height="196" class="responsiveImage"></p>
   <p>&nbsp; </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Notice above that the ul which is given the tag of  image-gallery is also given a flex-wrap of wrap. so that as the screen layout  narrows, the images that don&rsquo;t fit begin to rearrange themselves to accommodate  the small screen widths till it finally is just a single column for the cell  phone display. </p>
   
<img src="Images/5.png" width="747" height="168" class="wideImg">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:-40.5pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:-40.5pt;">In that same CSS rule above, we  also justify-content to be centered, and gave a small gap between each image so  that they would not appear to be glued to one another.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:-40.5pt;">&nbsp;</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:-40.5pt;">This is the changes that we made  to the list items and then to the image itself that is in the list. We gave the  list a pointer, so we can see that it will do something when we hover over each  image. The rest of the rules in the following tags are pretty self-  explanatory.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:-40.5pt;">&nbsp;</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:-40.5pt;">&nbsp;</p>
   <p><img src="Images/6.png" width="231" height="230" class="responsiveImage"></p>
   <p>&nbsp; </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">You can see from the HTML, that the image, and the overlay  resides in-between each li opening and closing tag.</p>
   
   <p><img src="Images/7.png" width="463" height="76" class="wideImg"></p>
   <p>&nbsp; </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Here are the rules for the <span class="MsoIntenseEmphasis">overlay</span> and the <span class="MsoIntenseEmphasis">hover</span>. You can see we have some  interesting transitions going on here. Our background is given some  transparency by adding the little <strong><span style="line-height:115%; font-size:14.0pt; ">a</span></strong> after the <strong><span style="font-size:14.0pt; ">rgb</span></strong> colors.</p>
   
   <p class="MsoNormal">Setting the <strong><span style="font-size:14.0pt; ">scale</span></strong> to 0 by using <strong><span style="font-size:14.0pt; ">transform,</span></strong> is a little convoluted, but it has to  do with visibility of the element. Its size will be 0,0, which means nothing,  so you cannot see it. When we are not hovering, the overlay will have a size of  nothing. But things that you have set up for other elements on the page, such  as float or clear, will still work. So, in other words it doesn&rsquo;t try to break  things.</p>
   
   <p class="MsoNormal">The <strong><span style="font-size:14.0pt; ">transition</span></strong> here has to do with the speed that the overlay enlarges to cover the image, and  then shrinks back in and disappears. It will set things in seconds, which is  signified by the little <strong><span style="font-size:14.0pt; ">s</span></strong> which follows the numbers. The first number is how many seconds it takes for  the width to move, and the second number is talking about the height.  Ease-in-out, means that it will ease in smoothly and then ease out smoothly, or  slowly. The <strong><span style="font-size:14.0pt; ">all </span></strong>at  the beginning of the transition rule, just means that the movement should be  applied to all of the properties.</p>

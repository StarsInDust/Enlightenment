<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="Images/1.png" width="268" height="243" class="responsiveImage"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For the next couple of weeks, I will be presenting a set of  tools, which can be found in Blender. These things are called <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="line-height:115%; font-size:12.0pt; ">Loop Tools</span></span>, and they  are an amazing addition to your arsenal of gadgets. This is something that you  are most definitely going to want to add. Because they make a whole lot of  procedures that you are going to want to do in Blender, a whole lot easier.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Loop tools are only available in <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Edit</span></span> mode, so you won&rsquo;t  even find them if you try to access them in any other workspace.</p>
<br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="Images/2.png" width="297" height="86" class="responsiveImage"></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The thing about these Loop Tools, are that they are not  automatically given to you. Oh, Blender has them, but you will need to turn  them on first. This is similar to the way that your additional mesh items were  added to Blender, which were explained in an earlier tutorial. So, we will need  to be going into our Settings again.</p>


<h2><a name="_Toc190169280">How to Turn on Loop Tools</a></h2>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You will want to go to:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Edit-Preferences-  Add-ons</span></span> then just enable <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Loop Tools</span></span>.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc190169281">What Tools are available in the Loop Tools?</a></h2>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once you are in <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Edit</span></span> mode, you can <span class="BoldMaroonListChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">right  click</span></span> on the object, and then you will see you have access to <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Loop Tools</span></span>.</p>

<img src="Images/4.png" width="296" height="85" class="responsiveImage">

<p class="MsoNormal">These are the Tools that are available:</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc190169282">How to Bring in an Object correctly</a></h2>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Before you can bring your object into the Edit work space,  you want to make sure that you are doing things correctly. The problem is  Blender needs to think that this object is just one entity, and the tools will  not work if it does not look at your model in this way.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes you will only be working on one mesh object, then  you can bring that object into the Edit mode work space just fine. Once it is  in there you can separate that one object making it appear to be two, but doing  this separation in edit mode, will still have Blender thinking that it is  working with just one object.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The below image is displaying just one object; it is a plane  that we brought into edit mode. Then we did a few things to it, and just cut it  in half, while still in edit mode. So, Blender will still think of it as just  one object. This way there is no need to do anything prior to bringing it in to  the Edit mode work space.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc190169283">Joining an Object</a></h2>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On the other hand, if you start off with two different  objects in Object Mode, you will first need to join these two objects together,  so the Blender see them as one object.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To <span class="BoldMaroonListChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">join</span></span> an object together, we <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">select both objects</span></span> and then hit the <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">ctrl  key</span></span> with the <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">J key</span></span> on the key board. The image below is not yet  joined because you will see that the top cylinder has a red selection outline  around it, and the bottom cylinder has an orange one.</p>

<img src="Images/7.png" width="260" height="259" class="responsiveImage">

<p class="MsoNormal">Now hit:</p>
<p class="BlueBolden">Ctrl-J</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You will know they have been joined because both of the  outlines will be orange.</p>

<img src="Images/8.png" width="370" height="344" class="responsiveImage">

<p class="MsoNormal">Now you can bring this joined object into the <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Edit</span></span> <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">work space,</span></span> and start  working on it, using the Loop tools. This way working with Loop tools will be  just fine.</p>

<img src="Images/9.png" width="355" height="324" class="responsiveImage">

<p class="MsoNormal">Well, that is a short introduction to using these Loop  tools. Next week we will start taking each of these different tool options into  their own tutorial, and start breaking them down. This way you can become more  familiar with using them for yourself.  </p>

<img src="Images/1.png" width="268" height="238" class="responsiveImage">
<p class="MsoNormal">Last week, we took a look at the Main menu, which resides at  the very top of the Blender application. But Blender uses a whole lot of menus.  It has just about every time of menu that you can think of. This week, we will  be taking a look at the Sub menu, which is located right below the Tippy-Top  Main Menu.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc185419713">The Different Unique Menu System</a></h1>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Again, because the Menu system is so long, I split this  sub-header menu in half.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The sub menu is also a header type of menu, like the Tippy  top menu.</p>

<img src="Images/2.png" width="626" height="164" class="wideImg">

<p class="MsoNormal">But as I said, the menu system in Blender is quite diverse.  You have many different forms in which you can use to get to certain sections  that you want to get to. You have.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Header Menus:</strong> The Top two menus. Tippy-Top, and the  Sub menu.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Collapsing Menu:</strong> To gain extra space a header will  use a collapsing menu.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">  </p>
<img src="Images/3.png" width="631" height="151" class="responsiveImage">


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Select Menu:</strong> A select menu allows you to choose  between a set of options.</p>


<img src="Images/4.png" width="160" height="221" class="responsiveImage">

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Popover Menu: </strong>A popover menu is an overlay. And like  pop up they will include the arrow on the right-hand side of the menu button to  tell you that you can click here and have access to more options.</p>

<img src="Images/5.png" width="246" height="242" class="responsiveImage">

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Context Menu:</strong> Context menus are pop-ups opened with  either the menu key or the Right Mouse Button for easy access to different  options.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is the Menu key on the keyboard</p>

<img src="Images/6.png" width="326" height="140" class="responsiveImage">
<p class="BlueBolden">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can use either the menu key, or the Right mouse button,  and in Object mode you will come up with the same menu. As you can see, using  the right mouse button and clicking on the box will bring up all of these  different options, which can be very helpful.</p>
<img src="Images/7.png" width="453" height="538" class="responsiveImage">>


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Pie Menus:</strong> You also have Pie Menus. For instance,  hitting the Z button on the keyboard will bring up this menu, where you can  quickly enter different modes. Click on the box in the viewport first and then  hit the Z button on the keyboard.</p>


<img src="Images/8.png" width="575" height="480" class="responsiveImage">


<p class="MsoNormal">You also have this overlay type of menu in which you can  bring up by hitting the <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="line-height:115%; font-size:12.0pt; ">N</span></span> button in the viewport with the keyboard.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Sidebar menu:</strong> You can call this a side board panel,  or an extra type of menu. There is the major side bar menu will take up the  entire right side of the interface, but there is an additional type of panel,  which can be brought up in the view port itself.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click on the <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">N</span></span> key on the viewport in  Object mode to take a look at this menu.   You can also click on a tiny little arrow on the right side of the  viewport.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You will see that by popping open this menu you can change  things about the object, such as the location, Rotation, Scale and Dimensions.</p>


<h2><a name="_Toc185419714">The Item Tab</a></h2>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img src="Images/9.png" width="597" height="307" class="responsiveImage">


<p class="MsoNormal">You can also see that we have a few other tabs that we can  also view in this panel. You can get to them by going to the right side of this  panel and clicking on a tab.</p>

<p><img src="Images/10.png" width="428" height="294" class="responsiveImage"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h2><a name="_Toc185419715">The Tool Tab</a></h2>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This tab deals with the tool, you are using and the contents  will change based on that tool. The active tool that is up in this next image  is demonstrating what you will see with the Select tool, which is the first  tool in the tool panel on the left of the viewport.</p>

<img src="Images/11.png" width="300" height="261" class="responsiveImage">


<h2><a name="_Toc185419716">The View Menu</a></h2>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The view menu in the object mode seems to have a lot more to  do with the camera than the object on the screen.</p>

<img src="Images/12.png" width="242" height="474" class="responsiveImage">


<h2><a name="_Toc185419717">The Edit Tab</a></h2>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Here we are in the edit tab of this side, option- panel, but  our viewport is still in Object mode. And in object-edit tab button of this secret  panel, you will see that if you click on this last tab button, that you will find  the simple text of Boolean sitting there in the viewport. If you click on the  word Boolean in the viewport, it will take you to a Boolean object menu. </p>
<img src="Images/13.png" width="597" height="386" class="responsiveImage">

<p class="MsoNormal">There are very few procedures that you can do in Object  mode, since your object is in one piece, but cutting up this one piece is  something that you can do, so you will be presented with it. Besides adding new  objects, one more thing that can, and should be done in Object mode is to  mirror an object. But mirroring is something that we will be taking a look at  in later chapters of this series. For now, we are just looking at the numerous different  menus, such as this Boolean menu inside of the Edit tab.</p>

<p><img src="Images/14.png" width="482" height="221" class="responsiveImage"></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc185419718">The Right -Side Panel</a></h2>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This may not exactly be a menu but more of a side panel  filled with a lot of things property-wise that you can do in Blender. At the  top of this side panel is a section that shows you what you have in your scene.  This can be called a Scene Collection, or it is sometimes referred to as an  outliner.</p>


<h3><a name="_Toc185419719">The Top section of the Ride- Side Panel</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Here you can tell that we have in the viewport a camera, a  cube, and a light.</p>

<p><img src="Images/15.png" width="378" height="265" class="responsiveImage"></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p class="BlueBolden">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And if you look in the viewport, you can see that is what we  do have.</p>

<img src="Images/16.png" width="608" height="380" class="responsiveImage">


<h2><a name="_Toc185419720">The Property Panel</a></h2>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The property section of this side panel is humongous, and it  actually will change depending on if you are working on an object, the camera  or the light. If you are confused that you cannot find the properties for the  Light or the camera, it is because each of them will need to be clicked on in  able to see the tab for them in the tabs on the left of this panel. Since this  panel is so large, it will take another tutorial in order to introduce all the  sections to you. For now just realize that the properties are there for just  about anything you find that you want to do in Blender.</p>


<h3><a name="_Toc185419721">The Property tabs for the Object</a></h3>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img src="Images/17.png" width="450" height="550" class="responsiveImage">

<h3><a name="_Toc185419722">The Property tabs for the light</a></h3>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Remember, click on the light in the viewport to see the tab  for the lights pop up in the list of icons at the left of the Property panel.</p>

<img src="Images/18.png" width="778" height="433" class="wideImg">
<p class="BlueBolden">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BlueBolden">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc185419723">The Properties for the Camera</a></h3>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Remember to click on the camera in the viewport in order to  see the tab for the camera to come up.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:-58.5pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<img src="Images/19.png" width="795" height="449" class="wideImg">

<p class="MsoNormal">Well, that is about it for explaining about the different  types of menus, and even some panels that you will come across in Object mode.  Some of your workspaces may share the same stuff in their menus, but a lot of  the things you will find in the menus of each workspace will be unique to being  able to perform the specific task that the workspace was created to allow you  to do.</p>

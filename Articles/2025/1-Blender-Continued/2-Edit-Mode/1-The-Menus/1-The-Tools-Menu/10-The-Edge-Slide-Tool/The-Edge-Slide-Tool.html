<h1><a name="_Toc188528544">What is the Edge Slide Tool?</a></h1>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is an interesting tool, in which you can slice one or  more edges across faces that are sitting next to each other (adjacent faces). Although,  this tool will come with a few restrictions. These restrictions deal with the  selection of edges. For example, the selection of an edge must qualify as a  valid loop, so the edge needs to be closed and not open ended.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc188528545">How To use the Edge Slide Tool</a></h1>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once again, we can just start off with our default cube and  bring it into the <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="line-height:115%; font-size:12.0pt; ">Edit</span></span> Mode workspace.</p>
<p class="BlueBolden">&nbsp;</p>
<img src="Images/3.png" width="382" height="304" class="responsiveImage">
<p class="BlueBolden">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We will be working with edges with this tool, so change to <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Edge mode</span></span> and select  one of the edges.</p>

<img src="Images/4.png" width="528" height="407" class="responsiveImage">

<p class="MsoNormal">Now grab your <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Edge Slide</span></span> tool, from the  tool box.</p>

<img src="Images/5.png" width="124" height="116" class="responsiveImage">

<p class="MsoNormal">With this front, top edge selected, If you push back on the  stick, you are narrowing the top face, but if you push the stick forward- downward,  you are working with and narrowing the front face.</p>

<p><img src="Images/6.png" width="482" height="244" class="responsiveImage"></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h1><a name="_Toc188528546">Selecting Two Edges</a></h1>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can start with your cube and then you can select two  edges. This way we can work with both of them</p>

<img src="Images/7.png" width="236" height="275" class="responsiveImage">

<p class="MsoNormal">If you pull forward on the stick, you won&rsquo;t do too much more  than just shrinking the height of the box. Because all you are doing is reducing  the height of both the front and back faces. But if you push backwards on the  yellow stick, and work with that top face, you will cause the face in between  the two edges (the top face) and this will shrink that face to a point, and  then you have something that looks like a pointed roof top.</p>

<img src="Images/8.png" width="475" height="231" class="responsiveImage">

<h1><a name="_Toc188528547">Edge Slide Dialog Box</a></h1>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Edge Slide tool comes with one of those <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Last operation dialog</span></span> boxes, and this time it pertains to the Edge slide tool.</p>

<img src="Images/9.png" width="359" height="219" class="responsiveImage">
<p class="BlueBolden">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you slide the <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Factor </span></span>Slider back and forth,  you are changing the amount of narrowness that you are giving to the affected face,  using this tool. This slider does basically the same thing as if you moved the  yellow stick on the Edge Slide tool back and forth.</p>

<img src="Images/10.png" width="619" height="531" class="responsiveImage">


<p class="MsoNormal">If you ticked the check box for the <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Even</span></span> option, you  would be making sure that your edge loop runs straight across an object.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Here we are taking a simple plane and extruding one of its  sides to demonstrate this. Extruding a plane in this way will make it so that  we have two faces, one right next to the other (adjacent faces). We are going  to move things around a bit on those two faces, so we have something that looks  more like our next illustration. Then we just added a loop cut to it. You will  notice that the loop cut will come in like this. A tad bit bent.</p>
<p><img src="Images/11.png" width="355" height="311" class="responsiveImage"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We can slide this loop cut down a bit using the <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Factor</span></span> slider.</p>

<img src="Images/12.png" width="422" height="386" class="responsiveImage">

<p class="MsoNormal">Tic on the <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Even</span></span> check box and the loop  cut will jump to the top of the object, and try and even itself out.</p>

<p><img src="Images/13.png" width="434" height="440" class="responsiveImage"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With the <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Even</span></span> Check box checked, we can now take advantage of  the checkbox below it to <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">flip</span></span> the <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Even</span></span> Setting. You will see  that will jump to a new location on the two faces, but still try to even itself  out.</p>

<img src="Images/14.png" width="622" height="567" class="responsiveImage">

<p class="MsoNormal">The <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Clamp</span></span> checkbox is actually better illustrated with the cube. Here we have the Clamp  setting on, and we have narrowed our top face into this position with the edge  slide tool. If you uncheck the clamp tool now, you really won&rsquo;t see much  difference. That is because it is clamping down this first position so that you  can make another move. So, now with the first move made just select the back  edge, on this cube, and bring that edge downward into a new position. </p>

<img src="Images/15.png" width="624" height="377" class="responsiveImage">

<p class="MsoNormal">Now un Clamp that second movement by unchecking the box and  you will see that the edge jumps back to its original position. So, it is  unclamping itself and negating that second move.</p>

<img src="Images/16.png" width="333" height="398" class="responsiveImage">

<p class="MsoNormal">The <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Mirror  Editing</span></span> checkbox, is something that would be used if you had cut  the object in half, and was working from one side of the object and having  Blender automatically and simultaneously building the other side of the object  based on your movements on the first side. We are not quite there yet, so for  now we will just skip over this setting.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You won&rsquo;t be using the <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Correct UV</span></span> setting either,  until you start to get into adding 2D textures to the 3D model, and this corrective  check box would help with issues resulting from image distortions during these addition  of textures type of procedures.</p>


<h1><a name="_Toc188528548">The Vertex Slide Tool</a></h1>
<p class="tableOfContents" ><a href="#_back_to_top">~back to top~</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Vertex  Slide</span></span> tool isn&rsquo;t too much different from the Edge slide tool,  except that you will move into <span class="BlueBoldenChar"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Vertex</span></span> selection mode, and  deal with vertices, instead of edges.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You will find this tool tucked underneath of the Edge Slide  tool, and you can get to it by going to the little arrow in the bottom  right-hand corner of the tool.</p>

<img src="Images/17.png" width="257" height="111">

<p class="MsoNormal">You can play with this tool, but it is just about the same  thing as sliding around an edge. And even the dialog box is the same.</p>

<img src="Images/18.png" width="383" height="442" class="responsiveImage">
<p class="BlueBolden">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Well, that is about it, and just about everything you need  to know about this tool, and sliding around edges in Blender.</p>
